# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Github page: https://diogofcmartins.github.io/tic-tac-toe-game/

This project sets up a Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, following best practices in modular JavaScript design. The game logic is structured with:

A Gameboard object to manage the board state.
Player objects to store player data.
A Game Controller to handle game flow and logic.
A Display Controller to manage the DOM and user interactions.

### Key Features:
âœ… Object-oriented design with factories and the module pattern. <br />
âœ… Minimal global code for better maintainability.  <br />
âœ… Console-based logic before integrating with the DOM.  <br />
âœ… Dynamic UI updates to reflect game progress.  <br />
âœ… Input validation to prevent invalid moves.  <br />

This project emphasizes clean code organization, ensuring each function resides in a logical place. The goal is to create a smooth, interactive experience while keeping the core logic modular and reusable. ðŸš€
